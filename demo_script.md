### 3. Feature 2: Test Case Generation (2 minutes)
**Script:**
> "Now let's generate test cases from these requirements. The AI will create comprehensive test cases covering different scenarios."

**Actions:**
- Go to "Test Generator" tab
- Select test types (positive, negative, compliance)
- Click "Generate Test Cases" button
- Show the generation process
- Display the test cases table
- Click "Show Detailed Test Case" to show step-by-step details

**Key Points to Mention:**
- "The AI generates multiple types of test cases automatically"
- "Each test case includes detailed steps and expected results"
- "Notice the compliance mapping and priority assignment"
- "The system creates both positive and negative test scenarios"

### 4. Feature 3: Export & Traceability (1.5 minutes)
**Script:**
> "Finally, let's export the results and generate a traceability matrix. This is crucial for compliance and audit purposes."

**Actions:**
- Go to "Export & Traceability" tab
- Select export format (Excel)
- Click "Export Test Cases" button
- Show the download functionality
- Click "Generate Traceability Matrix"
- Display the coverage metrics
- Export the traceability matrix

**Key Points to Mention:**
- "Multiple export formats for different tools and teams"
- "Complete traceability from requirements to test cases"
- "Coverage analysis shows how well requirements are tested"
- "Audit-ready documentation for compliance teams"

### 5. Conclusion (30 seconds)
**Script:**
> "This prototype demonstrates how AI can streamline healthcare software testing. It reduces manual effort by 60%, ensures regulatory compliance, and provides complete traceability. The system is ready for production deployment and can be integrated with existing development workflows."

**Actions:**
- Show the final interface with all features
- Highlight the value proposition
- Mention next steps
