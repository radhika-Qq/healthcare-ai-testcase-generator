# AI Models Architecture and Integration Strategy

## Overview

The Healthcare AI Test Case Generator leverages multiple AI models and services to provide intelligent requirement parsing and test case generation. This document outlines the AI architecture, model selection rationale, and integration strategies.

## AI Models Used

### 1. Google Vertex AI (Primary)

**Model**: Gemini Pro
**Purpose**: Requirement extraction and test case generation
**Capabilities**:
- Natural language understanding for healthcare terminology
- Context-aware requirement parsing
- Intelligent test case generation
- Compliance-aware content creation

**Integration Strategy**:
```python
# Vertex AI Integration
from google.cloud import aiplatform
import vertexai
from vertexai.generative_models import GenerativeModel

# Initialize Vertex AI
vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)
model = GenerativeModel("gemini-pro")
```

**Configuration**:
- Temperature: 0.7 (balanced creativity and consistency)
- Max tokens: 8000 (sufficient for complex requirements)
- Safety settings: Healthcare-appropriate content filtering

### 2. Google Gemini API (Fallback)

**Model**: Gemini Pro
**Purpose**: Alternative AI processing when Vertex AI unavailable
**Capabilities**:
- Same core functionality as Vertex AI
- REST API integration
- Simplified authentication

**Integration Strategy**:
```python
# Gemini API Integration
import google.generativeai as genai

genai.configure(api_key=API_KEY)
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro')
```

### 3. Rule-Based Fallback System

**Purpose**: Ensures system reliability when AI services unavailable
**Components**:
- Pattern matching for requirement extraction
- Template-based test case generation
- Compliance reference mapping
- Priority determination algorithms

## AI Model Selection Rationale

### Why Gemini Pro?

1. **Healthcare Domain Expertise**: Trained on medical literature and healthcare data
2. **Multimodal Capabilities**: Handles text, structured data, and document formats
3. **Safety and Compliance**: Built-in safety filters for healthcare content
4. **Scalability**: Handles large documents and batch processing
5. **Cost Effectiveness**: Competitive pricing for enterprise use

### Alternative Models Considered

1. **GPT-4**: Excellent performance but higher cost and less healthcare-specific training
2. **Claude**: Good reasoning but limited healthcare compliance features
3. **OpenAI GPT-3.5**: Cost-effective but less capable for complex healthcare requirements

## Prompt Engineering Strategy

### 1. Requirement Extraction Prompts

#### Base Prompt Template
```
You are a healthcare software requirements analyst. Extract all functional and non-functional requirements from the following healthcare software specification document.

Focus on:
- Patient safety requirements
- Data privacy and security requirements
- Regulatory compliance requirements (FDA, ISO, IEC, GDPR, HIPAA)
- Medical device functionality
- Clinical workflow integration
- Risk management requirements

For each requirement, provide:
- Unique requirement ID (REQ-XXX format)
- Clear, testable description
- Requirement type (functional, non-functional, performance, security, compliance, usability, reliability)
- Priority level (critical, high, medium, low)
- Compliance references
- Acceptance criteria
- Dependencies

Document content: {document_text}
```

#### Healthcare-Specific Enhancements
- Include medical terminology context
- Emphasize patient safety considerations
- Highlight regulatory compliance requirements
- Focus on clinical workflow implications

### 2. Test Case Generation Prompts

#### Base Prompt Template
```
Generate comprehensive test cases for the following healthcare software requirement.

Requirement: {requirement_details}
Compliance Standards: {compliance_refs}

Generate test cases including:
1. Positive test scenarios (happy path)
2. Negative test scenarios (error handling)
3. Boundary value testing
4. Security testing
5. Compliance validation testing
6. Performance testing (if applicable)

For each test case, include:
- Unique test case ID (TC-XXX format)
- Descriptive title
- Detailed description
- Step-by-step actions
- Expected results
- Test data requirements
- Prerequisites
- Pass/fail criteria
- Estimated duration
- Compliance validation steps

Focus on healthcare-specific testing including:
- Patient safety validation
- Data privacy and security testing
- Regulatory compliance verification
- Medical device functionality testing
- Clinical workflow validation
- Audit trail verification
```

### 3. Compliance Validation Prompts

#### FDA Compliance Prompt
```
Validate the following test case against FDA 21 CFR 820 (Quality System Regulation) requirements:

Test Case: {test_case_details}
Requirement: {requirement_details}

Check for:
1. Design controls documentation
2. Risk management validation
3. Verification and validation requirements
4. Corrective and preventive action testing
5. Quality system compliance

Provide compliance score (0-100) and specific recommendations.
```

## Model Performance Optimization

### 1. Token Management

**Strategy**: Chunk large documents to stay within token limits
```python
def chunk_document(text, max_tokens=6000):
    """Split large documents into manageable chunks"""
    words = text.split()
    chunks = []
    current_chunk = []
    current_tokens = 0
    
    for word in words:
        if current_tokens + len(word) > max_tokens:
            chunks.append(' '.join(current_chunk))
            current_chunk = [word]
            current_tokens = len(word)
        else:
            current_chunk.append(word)
            current_tokens += len(word)
    
    if current_chunk:
        chunks.append(' '.join(current_chunk))
    
    return chunks
```

### 2. Response Caching

**Strategy**: Cache AI responses to reduce API calls and costs
```python
import hashlib
import json
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
def cached_ai_request(prompt_hash, model_name):
    """Cache AI responses based on prompt hash"""
    # Implementation for caching AI responses
    pass
```

### 3. Error Handling and Retry Logic

```python
import time
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential

@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10))
def robust_ai_request(prompt, model):
    """Robust AI request with retry logic"""
    try:
        response = model.generate_content(prompt)
        return response
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"AI request failed: {e}")
        raise
```

## Compliance and Safety Considerations

### 1. Data Privacy

- **Local Processing**: Process sensitive data locally when possible
- **Encryption**: Encrypt data in transit and at rest

### 2. Healthcare-Specific Safety

- **Content Filtering**: Filter inappropriate or unsafe content
